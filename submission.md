title: "Submission"
---

On the 29th of November, you will be able to access the test set to produce your models’ final predictions. You must use the test set to generate your predictions for submission and complete your results using the “template.csv” file, which contains only test IDs. README files with further details will be included in the test set archives. You can submit up to 3 results coming from 3 different models, and the best model will be considered. Invited papers should introduce the models they attempt. All attempts should be submitted before the deadline with the naming: PROCESS task1 model1.csv, PROCESS task2 model1.csv (or one of two).
